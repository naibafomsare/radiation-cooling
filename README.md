# Radiation-cooling

The aim of the project is to design a system for extracting heat via radiation from a fused silica mirror that is part of an interferometric gravitational wave detector that works at room temperature.

As usual, the project has a theoretical part and an experimental one. Roughly, the general procedure for the theoretical part is the following:

1. Given the properties of fused silica, the shape of the mirror, and the power of the incoming beam, calculate the amount of heat dissipated in the mirror. The aim of the system is to be able to extract this amount of heat, or at least to reduce it to acceptable levels.
     
3. Then, it should be possible to calculate the deformation and the temperature map of the mirror. For example, see [this technical note](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiw47mF6t2CAxWWLUQIHc9PBQUQFnoECBQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopensky.ucar.edu%2Fislandora%2Fobject%2Freports%253A7%2Fdatastream%2FPDF%2Fdownload%2Fcitation.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2-d9chybtS9aTcPbrS1V10&opi=89978449).
4. Given the temperature map, calcuate the angular distribution of the thermal radiation.
5. Then, according to the angular distribution, select a suitable place to put a folding mirror that would reflect the thermal radiation onto a sink.
6. The aim of the folding mirror is to optimize the amount of radiation reaching the sink. Its shape and its material will depend on the properties of the radiation within the solid angle it spans, the position of the mirror, and the position and shape of the sink.

The information 

The experimental setup developed by Ra√∫l is useful to monitor the deformation of the mirror surface.
- Would it work better upon refraction rather than reflection?
