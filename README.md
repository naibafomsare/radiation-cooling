# Radiation-cooling

This system is for extracting heat from a mirror in a room temperature interferometric gravitational wave detector.

1. Given the material of the mirorr and the power of the incoming beam, calculate the amount of heat dissipated in the mirror.
2. Then, it should be possible to calculate the deformation and the temperature map of the mirror when there's no coooling. As an example, see [this technical note](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiw47mF6t2CAxWWLUQIHc9PBQUQFnoECBQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopensky.ucar.edu%2Fislandora%2Fobject%2Freports%253A7%2Fdatastream%2FPDF%2Fdownload%2Fcitation.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2-d9chybtS9aTcPbrS1V10&opi=89978449).
3. Given the temperature map, calcuate the angular distribution of the thermal radiation.
4. Given the angular distribution of thermal radiation, select a suitable place to put a folding mirror that would reflect the thermal radiation to a sink. The function of the folding mirror is to optimize the amount of radiation reaching the sink
5. The shape of the folding mirror and its material will depend on the properties of the radiation within the solid angle it spans, and the position of the mirror and the sink.

The experimental setup developed by Ra√∫l is useful to monitor the deformation of the mirror *surface*.
- Would it work better upon refraction rather than reflection?
